# ClientPanel

Angular application for keeping track of client debts, built following Traversy Media's 'Angular Front to Back' course. The app utilises Firebase for the back-end, along with Bootstrap for general styling.

ClientPanel is designed for use by one company, with users being able to change a setting within the app to allow other staff members to register and view the same list of clients/balances (this registration setting is saved in local storage).

The app is deployed on Firebase Hosting and can be accessed here: **https://client-panel-c4872.firebaseapp.com/**
